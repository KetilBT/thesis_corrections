  abstract     = {This paper considers the topic of finding prior distributions when a major component of the statistical model depends on a nonlinear function. Using results on how to construct uniform distributions in general metric spaces, we propose a prior distribution that is uniform in the space of functional shapes of the underlying nonlinear function and then back-transform to obtain a prior distribution for the original model parameters. The primary application considered in this article is nonlinear regression, but the idea might be of interest beyond this case. For nonlinear regression the so constructed priors have the advantage that they are parametrization invariant and do not violate the likelihood principle, as opposed to uniform distributions on the parameters or the Jeffrey's prior, respectively. The utility of the proposed priors is demonstrated in the context of nonlinear regression modelling in clinical dose-finding trials, through a real data example and simulation. In addition the proposed priors are used for calculation of an optimal Bayesian design.},

  abstract      = {We describe the R package acebayes and demonstrate its use to find Bayesian optimal experimental designs. A decision-theoretic approach is adopted, with the optimal design maximising an expected utility. Finding Bayesian optimal designs for realistic problems is challenging, as the expected utility is typically intractable and the design space may be high-dimensional. The package implements the approximate coordinate exchange algorithm to optimise (an approximation to) the expected utility via a sequence of conditional one-dimensional optimisation steps. At each step, a Gaussian process regression model is used to approximate, and subsequently optimise, the expected utility as the function of a single design coordinate (the value taken by one controllable variable for one run of the experiment). In addition to functions for bespoke design problems with user-defined utility functions, acebayes provides new functions tailored to finding designs for common generalised linear and nonlinear models. The package provides a step-change in the complexity of problems that can be addressed, enabling designs to be found for much larger numbers of variables and runs than previously possible. We provide tutorials on the application of the methodology for four illustrative examples of varying complexity where designs are found for the goals of parameter estimation, model selection and prediction. These examples demonstrate previously unseen functionality of acebayes.},
